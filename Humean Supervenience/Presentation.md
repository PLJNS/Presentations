Introduction
============

Background and Strategy
-----------------------

### Background

-   Published 14 years after "A Subjectivist's Guide to Objective
    Chance."
-   Lewis is extending the work done in the "New Work for a Theory of
    Universals" to indeterministic worlds.
-   Goal: That a reduction of laws and chances together into a Humean
    picture of the world is both possible and tenable. Lewis wants the
    Principal Principle *and* the Best-Systems Account of Laws, and he's
    going to solve the huge problem of holding these naively.

### Strategy

1.  Reintroduce Humean Supervenience and the Best-System Analysis of
    Laws.
2.  Develop and reject symmetry and frequency as solutions to chance.
3.  Introduce probabilistic laws and the addition to BSA that makes it
    possible: fit.
4.  Bring up a problem for a Humean analysis of chance with undermining.
5.  Solve the problem.

Set up
======

Humean Supervenience Reintroduced
---------------------------------

### The thesis

-   We can be *a priori* certain that any continent truth is made true
    by the pattern of instantiation of fundamental properties and
    relations by particular things. "Truth supervenes on being."
-   If two possible worlds are at all discernible, it must be because
    they differ in what things are in them or how those things are.
-   So what are the "fundamental properties and relations"?
    -   Armstrong: Immanent universals
    -   Williams: Families of exactly resembling tropes
    -   Humean Supervenience:
        1.  The fundamental relations are exactly the spatiotemporal
            ones.
        2.  The fundamental properties are local qualities.
        3.  All else supervenes on the spatiotemporal arrangement of
            local qualities throughout all of history.

### Defending Humean Supervenience

> The point of defending Humean Supervenience is not to support
> reactionary physics, but rather to resist philosophical arguments that
> there are more things in heaven and earth than physics has dreamt of.
> Therefore if I defend the *philosophical* tenability of Humean
> Supervenience, that defense can doubtless be adapted to whatever
> better supervenience thesis may emerge from better physics.

-   But even classical physics raises questions for Humean
    Supervenience. Is a vector field an arrangement of local qualities?
-   Humean Supervenience is *contingent*, that it's true when of worlds
    that are free of fundamental properties that are alien to ours.

### Spinning disks

-   Counterexample of the spinning sphere. Take two worlds with
    spherical homogenous matter, but one is spinning and one is
    stationary.
-   The way this world is not like ours is that ours is a "temporal-
    parts-world."

Symmetry and Frequency
----------------------

### Chance and credence

Chance
:   Objective single case probability.

Credence
:   Degree of belief.

-   Chance is connected to credence: if a rational believer knew that a
    chance of an event was 50%, then almost no matter what else she may
    know or note would chance the credence of one event happening.
-   Consider the consequences of Humean Supervenience on a credence
    function.
-   That is, that *whatever makes it true* that the chance is 50% must
    also be *whatever makes it rational* to believe to degree 50% that
    the event will occur, if known.
-   Lewis now proposes two candidates for chance-makers: *symmetries*
    and *frequencies*.

### What are symmetries?

-   Third paragraph of page 476,

    > Suppose a drunkard is wandering through a maze of T-junctions, and
    > at each junction we can find nothing that looks like a relevant
    > difference between the case that he turns left an the case that he
    > turns right. We could well understand if rational credence had to
    > treat the cases alike, for the lack of relevant difference. If the
    > symmetry is something that would, if known, constrain credence,
    > then it is suitable to serve as a chance-maker.

### Problems for symmetries

1.  There is no reason to think that we have symmetries to underlie the
    chance phenomena that we think there are.

    > It would be nice to think that each tritium atom contains a tiny
    > drunkard in a maze of symmetrical T-junctions.

2.  Symmetries are only defeasible constrainers of rational credence.
    Therefore, they can only be *defeasible chance-makers*.

    > The symmetry of the T-junctions would no longer require 50-50
    > division of credence if we also knew that, despite this symmetry,
    > the drunkard turns right nine times out of ten.

### What are frequencies?

Frequencies
:   A pattern in the spatiotemporal arrangement of qualities.

-   You can pretty easily intuit how these patterns could constraint
    rational credence.
-   Frequencies will not be a useful answer if we can't distinguish
    natural from gerrymandered kinds.
-   This is expressed best at the top of page 477, emphasis added,

    > Large chance systems seem to be put together out of many copies of
    > very small chance systems; and very small chance system often do
    > come in enormous classes of exact copies. *You see one tritium
    > atom, you've seen them all.*

### Problems for frequentism

1.  Consider $\text{unobtainium}^{346}$. It's hard to make the stuff, in
    all of space and time there have been only two. One had a lifetime
    of 4.8 microseconds, and the other a life of 6.1 microseconds. So
    what's the probability of decay? Ill-defined.
2.  Consider $\text{unobtainium}^{349}$. The isotope is even harder to
    make, and there isn't a single instance of it through space and
    time. So what's the probability of decay? Undefined.
3.  If space-time is finite with a small chance-system, then all
    frequencies will be rational numbers. Yet many real numbers are
    irrational, and we have no reason to doubt that chances in a finite
    world can take irrational values.

### Onwards to laws

-   The answer to the problem of unobtainium is remembering that
    single-case chances follow from general probabilistic laws of
    nature.
-   But what pattern in the arrangement of qualities makes the chances?

What is the Big Bad Bug?
========================

Best-System Analysis of Laws
----------------------------

### BSA reintroduced

> A regularity is a law if and only if it is a theorem of the best
> system.

-   Take all deductive systems whose theorems are true.
-   Some are *simpler*, better *systematized* than others.
-   Some are *stronger*, more *informative* than others.
-   These virtues compete: An uninformative system can be very simple
    and an unsystematized compendium of miscellaneous information can be
    information.
    -   The best system is the one that strikes as *good* a *balance* as
        *truth will allow* between simplicity and strength.
    -   How good this is will depend how kind nature has been.

### The problem of standards

-   Where do the *standards* of simplicity and strength come from?
    -   It *seems* to be from us. But that can't be right!
    -   We can change the laws make them always have been different,
        just by changing the way we think!
    -   Lewis uses to think that *rigidification* solved the problem.
        Lewis now thinks this is cosmetic only.
-   If "nature is kind to us", the problem needn't arise.
    -   Simplicity and strength are partly a matter of psychology.
    -   It's not because of how we think that a linear function is
        simpler than a quartic or step function, for example.
    -   If nature is kind, then the best system will be *robustly* best.
    -   This trouble is with unkind nature, not on Lewis' analysis.
        Plus, "Cross the bridge when we get there."

The Best-System Analysis and Chance
-----------------------------------

### Fit

-   Goal: Modify the best-system analysis to make it deliver the chances
    and the laws in one "package deal." The way that Lewis does this?
    *Fit*.
-   Take all deductive systems that pertain not only history, but also
    to what the various outcomes are in various situations (like the
    decay probabilities).
-   Require these system to be true about history.
-   Some of these system will *fit* the actual course of history better
    than others.
-   The virtues of *simplicity*, *strength*, and *fit* trade off, and
    the best system is the system that get the best balance of all
    three.
    -   And hopefully, robustly better.

### Homogeneity

-   In simple cases, this account reduces to frequentism.
-   If all events fall into a large homogenous class, the following
    tradeoffs occur:
    -   To exclude the chances of these events costs too much to
        strength.
    -   To subdivide and assign different chances costs too much to
        simplicity.
    -   To assign equal chances different from the frequency will cost
        too much to fit.
-   The best-system might round off the actual frequency, and might have
    to do some weird work to account for gruesome classifications.
-   Again, Lewis is optimistic about their being a decisive front-runner
    despite these sorts of problems.

### Undermining

-   Take a particular time and let $C$ be the credence function for
    someone whose evidence is limited to the past and present.
-   Let $P$ be the function that gives the present chances of all
    propositions.
-   Take $A$ to be a propositions.
-   Let $E$ be any proposition that satisfies:
    1.  It specifies the present chance of $A$ in accordance with $P$.
    2.  It contains no inadmissible evidence about future history.

    $$C(A | E) = P(A)$$

-   If $A$ is an alternative future history with different present
    chances than the actual ones, and $E$ is the whole truth about the
    present chances, then:
    1.  $C(F|E) \not= 0$ because $F$ has some present chance.
    2.  $C(F|E) =0$ because they're inconsistent.

### A possible solution

-   Future events can undermine present chances. Can we assume that the
    future chances manifest perfectly in past events? No, and here's
    why:

The Problem of the Early Moment
:   What could make the chances at a moment not long after the
    beginning?

The Problem of Fluctuation
:   It is not to be expected that the different chance-making patterns
    in these different segments will all make the same chance of decay.

The Problem of Drift
:   Suppose early on, $J$s divide 50-50 between $K$s and not-$K$s, but
    so far there haven't been many $J$s together.

    Then we should *expect* that there might be a chance to be a run of
    $K$s or not-$K$s, that would significantly raise or lower the chance
    of the next $J$ to be a $K$.

    Then the chance of being a $K$ would drift to one or zero, and
    remain there for a long time after.

### "No refuge"

-   We can see how knowledge of frequencies or symmetries might
    constrain rational credence.
-   It's more difficult to see how "a special relation $N*$" could come
    to be known and constrain rational credence.
-   The challenge: how does knowing the fact that $N*(J, K)$ should make
    one believe to the degree it specifies that the next $J$ will be
    $K$.

Solving the Big Bad Bug
=======================

The Problem Restated
--------------------

### The problem, again

-   Our *problem* is, where $F$ is an *un-actualized future* that would
    *undermine* the *actual present chances* given by $E$, is that
    $C(F | E) = 0$ because $F$ and $E$ are inconsistent, but
    $C(F|E) \not = 0$ by the Principal Principle because $E$ specifies
    that $F$ has non-zero chance of coming about.
-   According to the best-system analysis, information about present
    chances is inadmissible because it reveals future history.
    -   But this information should be admissible, we use it everyday.
    -   Is every use of the Principal Principle fallacious?
-   We need to investigate the concept of *admissibility*.

### Admissibility

-   Admissibility admits of degree

    > A proposition $E$ may be imperfectly admissible because it reveals
    > something or or other about future history; and yet it may be very
    > nearly admissible, because it reveals so little as to make a
    > negligible impact on rational credence.

-   Degrees of admissibility are a relative matter.

    > The imperfectly admissible $E$ may carry lots of inadmissible
    > information that is relevant to whether $B$, but very little that
    > is relevant to whether $A$.

-   Near-admissibility may be good enough.

    > If $E$ specifies that the present chance of $A$ is $P(A)$, and if
    > $E$ is nearly admissible relative to $A$, then conclusion that
    > $C(A | E) = P(A)$ will hold, if not exactly, at least to a very
    > good approximation.

Finally, the Solution
---------------------

### Correction

-   Let $H_{tw}$ be the proposition giving the complete history of world
    $w$ up to and including time $t$.
-   Let $T_w$ be the complete theory of chance for world $w$.
-   Let $P_{tw}$ be the chance distribution at time $t$ and world $w$.
-   If $T_w$ were admissible, then the conjunction $H_{tw}T_w$ would
    also be admissible.
-   So we could put it for $E$ in the old Principal Principle.
-   Dropping the subscripts, we have:

    > (OP) $C(A|HT) = P(A)$

-   The correction Lewis favors is:

    > (NP) $C(A | HT) = P(A | T)$

### How does this help?

-   By conditionalizing on the theory of chance, you ignore undermining
    futures.
-   Take $A$ to be an undermining future of $F$: $$C(F|HT) = 0$$
    $$P(F) \not= 0$$ 
    $$P(F|T) = 0$$

### Against perfection

-   (NP) is better from a Humean perspective, but (OP) is more intuitive
    and "key to our concept of chance."
-   A feature of Reality deserves the name "chance" to the extent it
    occupies the role of chance.
-   Occupying the role means obeying the old Principle.
-   But undermining means that nothing occupies the role perfectly, so
    nothing perfectly deserves the name. But near enough is good enough.
-   And if nature is kind, the chances ascribed by the probabilistic
    laws of the best system will obey the old Principle to a very good
    approximation.
