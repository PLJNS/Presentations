Introduction
============

### 

\begin{center}
We used to use a number of disparate services to provide
source control, issue tracking, and documentation for deliverables.

But now, one service provides all three functionalities.

### Overview

-   GitHub Wikis are a place in your repository where we can share long-form content 
    about our projects, such as: 
    -   how to use it, 
    -   how it's been designed, and
    -   manifestos on its core principles.

-   Wikis can be edited directly on GitHub, or you can work with a text editor offline 
    and simply push your changes.
-   You can:
    -   Add images
    -   Create sidebars
    -   Create footgers
    -   Edit locally
    -   View history

Conclusion
==========

### 

\begin{center}
\huge GitHub allows us to \\
build better software, \\
together.
\end{center}

### Advanced Topics

-   GitHub lets you publish HTML straight to the web from any branch 
    named "`gh_pages`", making a public face for your project.
-   GitHub supports mentioning people with @, linking issues using #, 
    using emoji, and adding images, all with drag-and-drop and autocomplete.
-   If you want to close issue #35, put closes #35 somewhere in your commit message. 
    Once the commit is in your default branch (usually master), the issue will be closed.
-   Markdown, the markup language used for GitHub documentation, is useful for much
    more than GitHub: this presentation was written in Markdown!

\begin{center}
After this presentation, I'll send an internal all email with a link 
where you can use your Local Wisdom email to create a GitHub profile
to get you started.
